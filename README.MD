# PRODIGY_DS_03

# Task-03 Analysis and Insights

## Project Overview

The **Task-03** notebook focuses on performing advanced data analysis to extract meaningful insights. This notebook builds on previous tasks, expanding into deeper exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformation, or possibly machine learning modeling (if applicable). The steps involve detailed data preparation, handling of complex relationships, and visualizations to support data-driven insights.

## File Structure

- **Task-03.ipynb**: Main notebook file containing all analysis, visualizations, and model implementations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation for setup, usage, and key steps.

## Requirements

To execute this notebook, ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model building (if included).
- `plotly` (optional): For interactive visualizations.

Install these packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly
